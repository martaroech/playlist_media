This program was the first and only "challenging" exercise of the Academy course regarding SpringBoot. It involves the creation and management of playlists, which can contain 3 different types of media (song, book, and podcast), which can also be created and managed. Everything is stored in a database, included in the repository in SQL format.

We made the calls using the Insomnia software, and its configuration file can be found here in JSON format.
